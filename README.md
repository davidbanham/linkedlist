A list that syncs. Allows you to create as many lists as you like locally. If there is a database of that name on the couch it's pointed at, it will sync to it. This syncing should scale to an arbitrary number of clients. New items will appear on all open lists in near-realtime.

All powered by Couch and Pouch.
